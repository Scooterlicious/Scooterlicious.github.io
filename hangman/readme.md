The mission was simple: "Create a hangman game"

Hangman is a great problem because it's well-understood--the requirements are clear.  But it's been done SO many times before.  I didn't want a hangman game that looked like anyone else's.

I came up with the concept for David's Little Secret after having a flashback to a fun refrigerator set a friend had long ago with clothes for famous art (Birth of Venus, Michangelo's David).
